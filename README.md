# Smart Infrastructure Design

## Introduction

Repo containing diagrams and documentation for the smart infrastructure design project.

## Contributing

Select a task from the [tasks](tasks.md) list and create a new branch to work on it. When you're done, create a pull request to merge your changes into the `main` branch.

Notify your team mates which task you're working on to avoid duplication of work.

## Diagrams

For diagrams use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create them. It's best to export them as `.drawio` files and commit them to the repo. This way, they can be edited later if needed.

## Documentation

For documentation, use Markdown files.

Here's a Markdown cheat sheet to help you format your text: [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). It should be pretty straightforward to use and sample files are provided in the repo.

If you're not familiar with Markdown, you can use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) to write your documentation. It's a web-based Markdown editor that allows you to preview your text as you write it.

VSCode allows you to preview Markdown files as well. Just open the file and press `Ctrl + Shift + V` to see the preview.
