# Smart Infrastructure Design

## Introduction

Repo containing diagrams and documentation for the smart infrastructure design project.

## Contributing

Select a task from the [tasks](tasks.md) list and create a new branch to work on it. When you're done, create a pull request to merge your changes into the `main` branch.

Notify your team mates which task you're working on to avoid duplication of work.

## Diagrams

For diagrams use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create them. It's best to export them as `.drawio` files and commit them to the repo. This way, they can be edited later if needed.

Do not edit existing diagrams without consulting the team first. Conflicting changes can be difficult to resolve. It's best to create a new diagram if you need to make changes.

## Documentation

For documentation, use Markdown files.

Here's a Markdown cheat sheet to help you format your text: [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). It should be pretty straightforward to use and sample files are provided in the repo.

If you're not familiar with Markdown, you can use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) to write your documentation. It's a web-based Markdown editor that allows you to preview your text as you write it.

VSCode allows you to preview Markdown files as well. Just open the file and press `Ctrl + Shift + V` to see the preview.

## Modules

Add new modules as needed. Each module should have its own folder with separate documentation files.
