# **Performance Monitoring System Documentation**

## **Overview**

The Performance Monitoring System is designed to monitor and ensure the reliability of the Smart Infrastructure Management System. It leverages **Prometheus** for metrics collection and alert generation, and **Alertmanager** for managing and routing alerts.

---

## **System Components**

1. **Prometheus**

    - Responsible for scraping, storing, and querying metrics from various services.
    - Supports rule-based alert generation.

2. **Alertmanager**

    - Handles alert routing, deduplication, and delivery.
    - Configurable to send notifications via email, Slack, PagerDuty, or custom webhooks.

3. **Monitored Services**
    - **Sensor Input Layer**: Handles real-time data from IoT devices.
    - **Load Balancers**: Manages incoming traffic distribution.
    - **Authentication Service**: Authenticates and authorizes users.
    - **Dashboard App**: Provides real-time infrastructure insights.
    - **Workers**: Executes background tasks such as data aggregation and report generation.
    - **External APIs**: Interfaces with external systems like municipal platforms and utility networks.

## **Metrics to Be Scraped**

Prometheus scrapes metrics from the following services:

1. **Sensor Input Layer**

    - Data ingestion rate.
    - Error rates for incoming data.

2. **Load Balancers**

    - Active connections.
    - Requests per second.
    - Latency statistics.

3. **Authentication Service**

    - Login success rate.
    - Token issuance latency.

4. **Dashboard App**

    - Page load times.
    - API response times.

5. **Workers**

    - Task queue length.
    - Task execution latency.

6. **External APIs**
    - API request rate.
    - API failure rates.

## **Alerting Mechanism**

1. **Alert Generation**

    - Prometheus generates alerts based on predefined rules. For example:
        - A high load balancer latency alert is triggered if the average latency exceeds a threshold for a specific period.
        - Task queue length alerts are triggered when the number of pending tasks exceeds a predefined limit.

2. **Alertmanager Configuration**

    - Alerts are routed to appropriate recipients based on severity and type.
    - Critical alerts are sent to on-call software engineers through tools like PagerDuty.
    - Warning-level alerts are routed to Slack channels or email groups.
    - Routing rules are based on alert labels, such as severity or service type.

3. **Alert Workflow**

    - Prometheus evaluates metrics against alerting rules and forwards alerts to Alertmanager.
    - Alertmanager groups similar alerts to reduce noise and ensures deduplication to avoid repeated notifications.
    - Notifications are sent to configured endpoints (e.g., Slack, email) with details about the issue.

4. **Silencing and Maintenance**
    - Alerts can be silenced during maintenance windows or for known, ongoing issues.
    - Silences are managed manually through the Alertmanager interface or via an API.

## **Future Scalability**

-   **Prometheus**:
    -   Use federation to scale across multiple regions and handle high-cardinality metrics.
    -   Shard scrape targets across different Prometheus instances to reduce bottlenecks.
-   **Alertmanager**:
    -   Deploy in a high-availability setup to prevent alert delivery interruptions.
-   **Notification Scaling**:
    -   Configure multiple redundant notification endpoints to ensure alerts are always delivered.

## **Conclusion**

The Performance Monitoring System ensures real-time performance insights, rapid incident detection, and efficient alert management for the Smart Infrastructure Management System. By leveraging Prometheus and Alertmanager, the system is robust, scalable, and adaptable to meet evolving infrastructure demands.
